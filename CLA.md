# Contributor License Agreement

*Copyright Assignment for AGPL-3.0 Licensed Projects*

---

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by the individual or entity identified below ("Contributor") in favor of **Avery Wagar** ("Maintainer"), for the purpose of defining the terms under which Contributions are made to any project owned or maintained by the Maintainer and licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.0 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation ("AGPL-3.0-or-later").

By submitting a Contribution to any such project, the Contributor agrees to the following terms and conditions for present and future Contributions. This Agreement supersedes any prior contributor agreements relating to the same subject matter. Except for the license and rights granted herein, the Contributor reserves all right, title, and interest in and to their Contributions.

## Definitions

**1. Contribution.** "Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by the Contributor to the Maintainer for inclusion in any project owned or managed by the Maintainer. For purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Maintainer or their representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by or on behalf of the Maintainer, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the Contributor as "Not a Contribution."

**2. Project.** "Project" means any software project owned, maintained, or managed by the Maintainer to which this Agreement applies, as designated by the Maintainer.

## Copyright Assignment

**3. Assignment of Copyright.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Contributor hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys to the Maintainer all right, title, and interest worldwide in and to the copyright in each Contribution, including all rights to register copyrights and to sue for past, present, and future infringement. This assignment includes, but is not limited to, the exclusive right to: (a) reproduce the Contribution; (b) prepare derivative works based upon the Contribution; (c) distribute copies of the Contribution to the public; (d) perform and display the Contribution publicly; and (e) sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties.

**4. Moral Rights.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Contributor waives and agrees not to assert any moral rights (including rights of attribution and integrity) that the Contributor may have in or with respect to any Contribution, and agrees that the Maintainer may freely use, modify, and redistribute the Contribution without attribution or notice to the Contributor. Where moral rights cannot be waived under applicable law, the Contributor agrees not to exercise such rights in a manner that would interfere with the Maintainer's use or distribution of the Contribution.

**5. License Back to Contributor.** Upon assignment, the Maintainer hereby grants to the Contributor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Contributor's Contributions and any derivative works thereof, under any license terms of the Contributor's choosing. This license back ensures the Contributor retains practical use of their own work.

## Enforcement & Licensing

**6. Enforcement Rights.** The Contributor acknowledges and agrees that the primary purpose of this copyright assignment is to vest in the Maintainer the sole and exclusive right to enforce the terms of the AGPL-3.0-or-later license (or any successor license chosen by the Maintainer for the Project) against third parties, including but not limited to the right to: (a) bring legal action for license violations; (b) seek injunctive relief and damages for unauthorized use; (c) negotiate settlements and compliance agreements; and (d) engage in any other enforcement activity the Maintainer deems appropriate to protect the integrity of the Project's licensing.

**7. Licensing Commitment.** The Maintainer agrees that the Project, including all Contributions received under this Agreement, shall be made available to the public under the AGPL-3.0-or-later license. The Maintainer reserves the right to additionally offer the Project under alternative or commercial license terms ("dual licensing"), provided that the AGPL-3.0-or-later licensed version of the Project remains publicly available. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the Maintainer's ability to relicense the Project under additional terms, so long as the AGPL-3.0-or-later version continues to be offered.

## Representations & Warranties

**8. Originality.** The Contributor represents that each Contribution is the Contributor's original creation and that the Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this Agreement. If any part of a Contribution is not the Contributor's original work, the Contributor shall clearly identify the source and any applicable[118;1:3u license restrictions at the time the Contribution is submitted.

**9. No Encumbrances.** The Contributor represents that the Contribution is free of any third-party claims, liens, or encumbrances, and that the Contributor has not entered into any agreement that would conflict with the rights granted under this Agreement.

**10. Legal Authority.** If the Contributor is making Contributions on behalf of an employer or other entity, the Contributor represents that they have the necessary authority to bind that entity to this Agreement, or that the entity has provided written authorization for the Contributor to enter into this Agreement.

**11. No Warranty of Contribution.** Except for the representations stated in this Agreement, the Contribution is provided on an "AS IS" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including without limitation any warranties or conditions of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

## General Provisions

**12. Entire Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, or communications, whether written or oral.

**13. Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, United States, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

**14. Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

**15. Successors and Assigns.** This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. The Maintainer may freely assign this Agreement. The Contributor may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Maintainer.

**16. Electronic Acceptance.** This Agreement may be accepted electronically. Submitting a Contribution to a Project after the date this Agreement is published in the Project's repository constitutes acceptance of this Agreement. Alternatively, the Contributor may sign this Agreement below.
