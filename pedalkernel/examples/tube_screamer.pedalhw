# Tube Screamer TS-808 — hardware component specs
#
# The TS circuit is simple and voltage-tolerant.  The clipping diodes
# are 1N4148 (100V breakdown), the cap is a 47nF film cap, and the
# pot/resistor are standard.  This file mostly serves as documentation
# — nothing here should warn below 24V.
